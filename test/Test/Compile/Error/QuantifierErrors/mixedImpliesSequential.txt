Error at Line 3, Columns 1-9: The property 'property' contains a sequence of quantifiers unsupported by Marabou.
Marabou cannot verify properties that mix both 'Forall' and 'Exists' quantifiers.
In particular the 'Forall' at Line 4, Columns 12-18 clashes with an 'Exists' derived as follows:
  1. the 'Forall' is originally located at Line 4, Columns 24-30
  2. which is turned into an 'Exists' by being on the LHS of the 'implies' at Line 4, Columns 49-51
Fix: if possible try reformulating 'property' in terms of a single type of quantifier.
