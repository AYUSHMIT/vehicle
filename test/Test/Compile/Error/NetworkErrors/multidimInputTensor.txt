Error: The type of network 'f' is not currently supported as the input 'Tensor Rat [1, 2]' is not a 1D tensor. (Line 1, Columns 13-29)
Fix: Only networks of type:
  1. Tensor A [m] -> Tensor B [n]
  2. A -> ... -> A -> B
are allowed, where A and B are one of [ Nat, Int, Rat ] and 'm' and 'n' are constants. Ensure that the network input is a 1D tensor.
