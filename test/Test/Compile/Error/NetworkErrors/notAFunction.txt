Error: The type 'Rat' of network 'f' is not currently supported as 'Rat' is not a function. (Line 1, Columns 13-16)
Fix: Only networks of the following types are allowed:
  Tensor A [m] -> Tensor B [n]
where 'A' and 'B' are one of [ Rat ] and 'm' and 'n' are constants. Provide both an input type and output type for your network.
