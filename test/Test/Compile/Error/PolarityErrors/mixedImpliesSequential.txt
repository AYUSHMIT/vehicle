Error at Line 3, Columns 1-9: The property 'property' contains a sequence of quantifiers unsupported by Marabou.
Marabou cannot verify properties that mix both 'forall' and 'exists' quantifiers.
In particular the 'forall' at Line 4, Columns 12-18 clashes with an 'exists' derived as follows:
  1. the 'forall' is originally located at Line 4, Columns 24-30
  2. which is turned into an 'exists' by being on the LHS of the '=>' at Line 4, Columns 49-51
Fix: if possible try reformulating 'property' in terms of a single type of quantifier.
