Error at Line 5, Columns 1-2: The property 'p' contains a sequence of quantifiers unsupported by Marabou.
Marabou cannot verify properties that mix both 'forall' and 'exists' quantifiers.
In particular the 'forall' at Line 6, Columns 5-11 clashes with an 'exists' derived as follows:
  1. the 'forall' is originally located at Line 6, Columns 17-23
  2. which is turned into an 'exists' by being on the LHS of the '=>' at Line 6, Columns 42-44
Fix: if possible try reformulating 'p' in terms of a single type of quantifier.
