Welcome to Vehicle's documentation!
===================================

.. note::

   This project is under active development.

**Vehicle** is a tool for enforcing specifications on neural networks.
Write your specification once in the high-level Vehicle language and
then:

 1. incorporate it during the training of your network (coming soon).
 2. use it to generate counter-examples that can be used in further training or rigorously prove that no such counter-examples exist.
 3. export the proof seamlessly to an Interactive Theorem Prover.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
